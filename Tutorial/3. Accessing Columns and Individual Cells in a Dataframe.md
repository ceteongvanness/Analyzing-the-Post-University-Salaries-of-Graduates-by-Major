# Accessing Columns Individual Cells in a Dataframe

1. To access a particular column from a data frame we can use the square bracket notation. You should see all the values printed out below the cell.

   ``` python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary']
   ```

2. To find the highest starting salary we can simply chain the `.max()` method. **The highest starting salary is $74,300**.

   ``` python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].max()
   ```

3. But which college major earns this much on coverage? For this, we need to know the row number of **index** so that we can look up the name of the major. Luck of us, the `.idmax()` method will give us index for the row with the largest value. **Which is 43**.

   ```python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].idxmax()
   ```

4. To see the name of the major that corresponds to that particular row, we can use the .loc(location) property. Here we are selecting both a column ('Undergraduate Major') and a row at index 43, so we are retrieving the value of a particular cell.

   ```python
   clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[43]
   ```

5. You might see people using the double square brackets notation to achieve exactly the same thing:

   ```python
   clean_df['Undergraduate Major'][43]
   ```

6. If you don't specify a particular column you can use the `.loc` property to retrieve an entire row.

   ``` python
   clean_df.loc[43]
   ```
