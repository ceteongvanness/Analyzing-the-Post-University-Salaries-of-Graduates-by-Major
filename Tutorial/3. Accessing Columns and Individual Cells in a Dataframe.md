# Accessing Columns Individual Cells in a Dataframe

1. To access a particular column from a data frame we can use the square bracket notation. You should see all the values printed out below the cell.

   ``` python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary']
   ```

2. To find the highest starting salary we can simply chain the `.max()` method. **The highest starting salary is $74,300**.

   ``` python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].max()
   ```

3. But which college major earns this much on coverage? For this, we need to know the row number of **index** so that we can look up the name of the major. Luck of us, the `.idmax()` method will give us index for the row with the largest value. **Which is 43**.

   ```python
   clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].idxmax()
   ```

4. To see the name of the major that corresponds to that particular row, we can use the .loc(location) property. Here we are selecting both a column ('Undergraduate Major') and a row at index 43, so we are retrieving the value of a particular cell.

   ```python
   clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[43]
   ```

5. You might see people using the double square brackets notation to achieve exactly the same thing:

   ```python
   clean_df['Undergraduate Major'][43]
   ```

6. If you don't specify a particular column you can use the `.loc` property to retrieve an entire row.

   ``` python
   clean_df.loc[43]
   ```

## Highest and Lowest Earning Degrees

**The Highest Mid-Career Salary**

If you have multiple lines in the same cell, only the last one will get printed as an output automatically. If you'd like to see more than one thing printed out, then you still have to use a print statement on the lines below.

```python
print(clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].max())
print(f"Index for the max mid career salary: {clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].idxmax()}")
clean_df['Undergraduate Major'][8]
```

**The Lowest Starting and Mid-Career Salary**

Here I've nested the code that we've seen in the previous lesson in the same line. We can also use the `.loc` property to access an entire row.

```python
print(clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].min())
clean_df['Undergraduate Major'].loc[clean_df['Starting Median Salary'].idxmin()]
```

Below I've accessed the row at the index of the smallest mid-career salary:

```python
clean_df.loc[clean_df['Mid-Career Median Salary'].idxmin()]
```

Sadly, education is actually the degree with the lowest mid-career salary and Spanish is the major with the lowest starting salary.
