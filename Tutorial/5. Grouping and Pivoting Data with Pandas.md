# Grouping and Pivoting Data with Pandas

1. Often times you will want to sum rows that below to a particular category. For Example, which category of degrees has the highest average salary? Is it STEM, Business or HASS (Humanities, Arts, and Social Science)?

   To answer this question we need learn to use the .groupby() method. This allows us to manipulate data similar to a Microsoft Excel Pivot Table.

   We have three categories in the 'Group' column: STEM, HASS and Business. Let's count how many majors we have in each category:

   ```python
   clean_df.groupby('Group').count()
   ```

2. Now can you use the .mean() method to find the average salary by group?

   ```python
   pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
   clean_df.groupby('Group').mean()
   ```
