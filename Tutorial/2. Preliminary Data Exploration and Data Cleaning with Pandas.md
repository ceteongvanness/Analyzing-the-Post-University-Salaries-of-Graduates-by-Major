# Preliminary Data Exploration and Data Cleaning with Pandas

1. We've already used the `.head()` method to peek at the top 5 rows of our dataframe. To see the number of rows and columns we can use the `shape` attribute:

   ````python
   df.shape
   ````

   ````python
   df.columns
   ````

2. Before we can proceed with our analysis we should try and figure out if there are any missing or junk data in our dataframe. That way we can avoid problems later on. In this case, we're going to look for NaN (Not A Number) values in our dataframe. NAN values are blank cells or cells that contain strings instead of numbers. Use the `.isna()` method and see if you can spot if there's a problem somewhere.

   ````python
   df.isna()
   ````
