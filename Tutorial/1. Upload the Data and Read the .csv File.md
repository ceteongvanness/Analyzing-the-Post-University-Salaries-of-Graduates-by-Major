# Upload the Data and Read the .csv file

1. Download the **salaries_by_college_major.csv** file from [Data](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Analyzing-the-Post-University-Salaries-of-Graduates-by-Major/tree/main/Data) folder and add this file to the notebook by dropping it into the sidebar with the litter folder icon.

2. Import the pandas into your notebook and read the .csv file.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd 
   ```

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('salaries_by_college_major.csv')
   ```

3. Save ctrl + space (Windows) or âŒ˜ + space(Mac).

4. Take a look at the Pandas dataframe we've just created with .head(). This will show us the first 5 rows of our dataframe.

   ```
   df.head()
   ```

5. Press **shift + Enter**, the cell will be evaluated and you should see that output automatically printed below the cell. This feature of automatically printing the output below in a pretty format is what makes the notebooks format so lovely to work with.
